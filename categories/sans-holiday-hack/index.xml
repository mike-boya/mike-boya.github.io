&lt;p&gt;Hello and Happy New Year! This year&amp;rsquo;s Holiday Hack Challenge theme was an online conference called KringleCon, a cyber security conference hosted by Santa and his elves. It had all the elements of an in-person conference, including talks, badges, swag and the ability to network with other attendees. The challenge was to solve all 10 objectives and each of the &amp;ldquo;Cranberry Pi&amp;rdquo; mini-challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The SANS Holiday Hack challenge this year was fantastic and I wanted to make sure
to document my solutions on my blog. I have participated in the Holiday Hack Challenges since 2012, but haven&amp;rsquo;t documented them with the exception of some informal notes &amp;ndash; maybe I should change that! Anyway, enjoy my write-up and I encourage anyone who did not participate to give it a try before reading this post!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
